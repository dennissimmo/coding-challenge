Today I have created selectors for Dicitonaries entity, then loaded countries flags from JSON file, after that registered first reducer, effects and setup DevTools.
Found important detail, that we should listed DevToolsModule after all other NGRX tools in imports array, because logging won't work at all.
After that I have created State, actions, reducer for User entity. SignIn, Up, Out actions, fixed some problems with types in usage old versions of Firebase.

Conclusion: 
1. Updated skills in problem solving
2. Practiced creating main NGRX components
