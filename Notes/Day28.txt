I've finished master class layout, learn some approaches when you can easily use grid and do not write excessive code.

Touched themes:
BEM, layout analyze, gap, adaptive value

Conclusion:

1. Finished layout
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
