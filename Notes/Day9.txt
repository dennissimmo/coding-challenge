Today I decided not to use russian course because its author just copied the main course and translated it, also made some changes,
used another project for example (domen is different, structure the same), gived a meaningful name for course lessons and add GIT section.
I have liked English course from the beginning, I initialized project and implement first page, add icon, two headers and button.
Mostly it was about adding animations, pseoudo classes and transform property. I learned how to center an absolute element inside relative container
by center X and Y axes and understood how it works, learn new animation properties and animations in general.


Yesterday I do not have English lesson so I think that I can spend more time on that beautiful course.
Also I have to learn some shortcuts which I will notice during development process

Touched themes:
animation, transform, @keyframes, pseoudo classes and ::after element, 3 pillars of CSS

Conclusion:

1. Started new course (10 lessons passed, environment, header section)
2. Improved knowledge about above listed properties, techniques
3. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
4. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
