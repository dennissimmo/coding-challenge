Today I finally finished course, during it I have created Slider and Change Theme functionality,
it wasn't hard and most part I did by myself. After it I realised that I need another course
to continue learning and start search for new courses and find on Udemy few courses.
I already decided to buy one but accidentally found coursehunter.net resourse.
There are listed many courses from Udemy and other platforms and by subscription
you can get access to these courses. I decided that it will be cheaper to buy this one instead of buy on Udemy.

During it I have found really cool and good sctructured courses about Angular, NGRX, Typescript and CSS.
So I have added the best of them to bookmarks and plan to continue my learning journey with them

Touched themes:
Today I practiced JS (listener, DOM selection, toggling classes), remind conception of adding themes.
From another course I remind about SEO importance, project structure and useful resources for learning
and created header, sidebar and featured sections, in short I have finished 1 section (CSS only)

Tommorow I plan to continue learning HTML + CSS by another course, cover almost all main CSS concepts

Conclusion:

1. Finish first course
2. Found many courses for further learning
3. Bought access to courses for a month
4. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find finally it)
5. Feel more confident as on my main job, talked with Team Lead about our project structure,
 architechure questions and showed my interest in project improvement
