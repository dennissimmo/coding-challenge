I've started learning of NGRX with a new syntax (I already made some study project with old syntax).
Identified advantages of using NGRX, described Flux concept and initialized project. 
Also I have created few Actions for CUD Categories and one Reducer for handling affect on State each of its actions.
Next steps are : Selectors, Modyfiyng State and working with Side Effects

Touched themes:
BEM, layout analyze, gap, adaptive value

Conclusion:

1. Structured knowledge about NGRX, understood its purpose, created Actions and Reducer
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
