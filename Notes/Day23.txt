Today was almost day of theory with a bit practice with Generics in TypeScript, I have covered many TS related questions about 
Generics, Mapped Types, Type, Interfaces, any vs unknown, Utility Types, also I refresh knowledge about RXJS library, update my notes and destructured it.
After this commit I gonna pass one more section of Englis for IT course on EnglishDom

Touched themes:
Generics, Ambient Declarations, Hot vs Cold Observables, Memory leaks, flattening operators, Subjects, ...

Conclusion:

1. Covered TypeScript related topics and RXJS related topics, conception and usage in Angular
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
