            In the night I hear 'em talk
        The coldest story ever told
        Somewhere far along this road
        He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
        How could you be so heartless?
        Oh, how could you be so heartless?
        How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo
        Just remember that you talkin' to me though
        You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
        I mean after all the things that we've been through
        I mean after all the things we got into
        Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
        Ayo, I did some things, but that's the old me
        And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
        So you walk around like you don't know me
        You got a new friend, well, I got homies
        But in the end it's still so lonely
        In the night I hear 'em talk
        The coldest story ever told
        Somewhere far along this road
        He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
        How could you be so heartless?
        Oh, how could you be so heartless?
        How could be so Dr. Evil?
        You bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
        I decided we weren't gon' speak so
        Why we up 3:00 a.m. on the phone?
        Why do she be so mad at me for?
        Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
