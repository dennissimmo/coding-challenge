In a search for a right course

It was really hard to find a right course, let's talk about 7 days bootcamp.
The best what I learned:
    - how to embed in your html some external widgets of Twitter, YouTube with <iframe> or loading <script>
    - shorthand of background property (image, repeat, attachment, position)
That's all

Next course is Mixer clone
From this course:
    - practiced using pseudo classes

Next course is Intermediate course, here we have created small movie app
This was the first course, where I started doing some interesting stuff:
    - practiced flex, pseudo classes
    - implemented theme switching, simple image slider
    - learned about font-awesome and correct fonts connecting
    - started to write class names in pseudo "BEM" manner)
    - implemented some fancy hover animations with transform

Next course is Bakery project
It was second advanced step in building layouts
During that course:
    - discovered concept of normalize
    - integrate Google Map widjet
    - worked with @import() in css

Next course is Portfolio project
There are were following things: 
    - created first Figma design on my own
    - started wright semantically correct "BEM" class names
    - started to use SCSS instead of CSS
    - started to use SCSS variables and nesting
    - learned how to right set margin / padding for elements, conception of :last-child
    - started to write adaptive with media queries from big to low width for all classes (iterative approach)

After this course I decided to switch to another author and started course Advanced CSS and SASS
It was very cool course where I have learned a lot of things, I'll try to list all of them below:
    - loading multiple stylesheets in NTML with <link> tag
    - parsing stages of CSS, Cascade, CSS object model, converting relative units to px
    - Render Tree, Box Model, resolving conflicts, rem instead of px
    - mixins, functions, extends, nesting, &:not(:last-child)
    - 7 to 1 concept for structuring project with SCSS files
    - utility classes, their need and usage, similar to Bootstrap classes
    - typography classes, animation-name,duration, customization with "BEM" modifiers
    - custom grid layout with floats
    - calc(), passing scss variables in calc expression, atrribute starts with selector [class^="col-"]
    - main scss file conception and partials, import by name without .scss extension
    - @keyframes - 0% - 50% - 100%
    - linear gradients
    - outline, change some elements style while hover another element
    - background-clip
    - custom button, :link, :visited, :active
    - two sides cards, backface-visibility, perspective, rotateY()
    - clip-path: polygon
    - align absolute element by center inside relative container
    - changing inner classes styles, during :hover parrent element with power of inheritance
    - box-decoration-break: clone, splitting span on multiple independent elements
    - transform: skewX()
    - shape-outside, clip-path: circle, floating text around images
    - :focus, :focus:invalid, ::webkit-input-placeholder, :placeholder-shown, custom radio button with <label> without JS,
    placeholder, required, name attributes
    - transform: rotate(5deg), box-shadow, filter: blur() brightness()
    - implementation custom burger menu, with animation of burger to cross, without JS, with :checked and <label for>
    - "solid gradient" : linear-gradient(120deg, transparent 0%, transparent 50%, $color-white 50%)
    - responsive images through HTML (srcset, sizes), different images based on screen size
    - figure, figcaption
    - popup with CSS, :target, anchor links # , backdrop-filter, 
    - column-count, column-gap, column-rule, hyphens => new CSS properties
    - media query manager with mixins, @if, @supports, overriding total font-size for <body> in % to make 1 rem = 10px
    - build, compress, concat, post, server, npm scripts

Yes, there were done many things and impelemented, hamburger, popup, checkbox, radio button with custom CSS and its power

Next course is about FlexBox from the same author
Within that course also were done many cool things:
    - covered conception of limiting container

    - named grid-columns and rows
    - repeat(), minmax(), auto-fit, auto-fill, min-content, max-content, fr

Lest decribe the last HTML + CSS related project is Master Class from Frylancer By Life

    - how to fast analyze design and split it on HTML elements
    - power of adaptiveValue property (need to describe it work in details)
    - advanced responsive conceptions

    - Forms, types, way to validation
    - Hot vs Cold observables, Flattening operators, creation functions, clean up logic, declarative approach, creation custom 
    observables, ways to unsubscribe
    - Generics, Ambient Declarations, Mapped Types, type vs interfaces, unknown vs any
    - types coercieon, shallow vs deep copy, basic concepts of JS
    - NGRX concepts, when to use, benefits, old vs new syntax, Flux approach
    - ...more what I cannot remember

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Final Conclusion
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

I have done a lot within it monthly challenge, I got confidence in building layouts with CSS, I learned, repeated a lot of 
theory and build more grasp knowledge in my head about different topics from Angular, RXJS, HTML, CSS, SCSS, TypeScript.

I was very cool experience, by the end of challenge I started running out of time, because of some events in my personal life,
but I am finishing that challenge in 03.02.2023 and I'm happy with results, I know that I can show better results, but we have 
what we have. I hope that those skills and knowledge will help in my search of a new job. 
It is obvious that I should have started such learning and practice most of things earlier and my learning curve was wrong.
First what you have to do it grasp base of each technology and only after that you can move to some advanced concepts or tell
someone that you know it technology and what worse call yourself as an expert. 

I think I will continue that challenge, but in a bit other way, actually I don't know in which way). My main goal was to get 
practical skills and theory knowledge in order to find a new job, today I got refusal from one company.
I will try to text all recruiters who were written to me and we will see result of it.

I will finish my speech with those words:

Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. (Winston Churchill)
