Today was a lot of practice, I've done tours and book sections. Within a tours section,
we made amazing flip card animation, naturally it just a rotateY() with a perspective, but I 
understood its conception, I learned how to change other classes when we have applied pseudo class
for a parent element it can be direct child, or nested child, no matter, also I deeply learn 
conception of utulity classes and how they can be very useful.
Shaping figures in combination with a clip path and shape-outside properties give us beautiful
affect. Box-decoration-break with "clone" property allows to us represent each brake of an element
as a separate element and apply margin/padding (any property) to them.
In the Book block I worked with :focus, :checked, :placeholder-show pseudo selectors,
create custom radio button over default one, replaced styles of default input placeholders with
::-webkit-input-placehold pseudo element, used "+" and "~" selectors, worked with <video> tag.

Touched themes:
video, input, perspective, shape-outside, box-decoration-break, front-back side card effect,
:focus, :checked, selectors, mixing gradients

Conclusion:

1. Continued course (9 lessons more passed)
2. Learned how to mix backgrounds (blend mode)
3. Learned how to create flip card effect
4. Learned how to align text around figures with shape-outside
5. Learned how replace default styles of input for diffent states (checked, focus, placeholder)
6. Learned how to create "custom" radio button
7. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
8. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
9. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
10. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
