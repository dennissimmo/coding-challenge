I have finished 7th Chapter of NGRX book. It wasn't so hard, but what was hard is dealing with strict mode of TypeScript
and setting types for NGRX entities. I don't understood what was the cause of problem and which format is proper for registering
reducers for Store Module, but with help of some guys from GitHub issues comments, I succeed and registered reducer.
The difference in syntax between versions is one of the problems in NGRX learning, conceptions are the same, syntax is another.
Today I gonna finish my challenge and write total report about what I have learned during thing period and why I failed last days
of challenge and postponed it on future days

Touched themes:
Reducers, types, Design Components, strict mode, modeling state, Selectors

Conclusion:

1. Finished Chapter 7 of NGRX essentials
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
