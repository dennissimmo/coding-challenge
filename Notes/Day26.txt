Refreshed knowledge about Directives, Services and Forms. I have confirmed that we can use TS classes in Angular without marking
them with @Injectable() if we don't inject another services inside it service.
Also I have continued learning an NGRX, on practice and my goal it get practice and deep knowledge with understanding of each concept

Touched themes:
BEM, layout analyze, gap, adaptive value

Conclusion:

1. Refresh answers on some interview questions about an Angular
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
