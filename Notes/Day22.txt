Today was day of theory. I have covered such themes as AOT vs JIT, Server Side Rendering, Lifecycle Hooks, Dependency Injection mechanism,
Injector types, Conception of Hierarchical Injector in Angular, Resolution and resolving dependencies, Change Detection, Forms, Forms Validation
and Standalone Components feature in Angular 14.
Also I've update my CV and wrote down about another my experience with Angular in a team of 6 members, my leadership and proactiveness.
After this commit I gonna pass one more section of Englis for IT course on EnglishDom

Touched themes:
Change Detection, Server Side Rendering, Forms, Dependency Injection, Compilation types, etc.

Conclusion:

1. Covered many Angular topics
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
