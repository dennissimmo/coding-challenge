Today I have finished Stepper component, author is used a bit complex  but at the same time interesting mechanism with Observables and Subjects for next, complete, cancel actions.
So before actually move to another step of Stepper or complete stepper, we emit a check notification that is handled by components of stepper and they actually decide if we 
can emit next or complete action. It use property name reference in order to emit proper subject based on check type, and then we subscribe to these Subjects inside Stepper 
component for next and inside Form componet for Complete and Cancel. I hope that I will better understand how it is actually work in further lessons.

Conclusion:
1. Finished Stepper component
