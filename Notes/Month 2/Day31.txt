Today I started second monthly challenge and first topic I decide Template Driven Development in Angular, I liked it in Java,
so I wanna try it in Angular as well. The process is simple, you write test, then make it successfully run, and after it you do refactoring code.
I setup a project, there were problems with instalation and setup of UIkit (I haven't worked with it before) and propert configuration of buiild options
in order to serve project, build and then run tests. But I successfully managed it and ran my first tests for Components in Angular.
I have finished with some problem inside tests for header bottom part, it will be start point for tomorrow


Conclusion
1. Started new challenge
2. Ran first Component tests
3. Managed to fix problems with tests
