Today I was repeating JS and started implementing new HTML layout

Touched themes:
Functions, Objects, scope, copying objects, immutability

Conclusion:

1. Refresh knowledge about base part of JS
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
