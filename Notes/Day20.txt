Today I spent more 5.5 hours on GRID technology, I learned its concept and example usages, considered all properties of GRID,
and built few GRID layouts during project implemenation. Also fixed some problems with gulp, Mac really sucks with installation of npm packages, constantly 
some problems. GRID technology is very powerful, minmax(), auto-fit, auto-fill, min-content, max-content properties allow to us do not right media queries
at all for our GRID layouts and I suppose together with clamp() for gap it can be even more powerful. As it was my second time when I decided to learn GRID,
I should remember about 40% of theory and 20% of practice, but after course must practice it more and more.

Strange ending of day, I've started at 6 p.m and finished at 1 a.m, I have to wake up at 7 a.m, because I gonna play footbal at 8 a.m, again my sleep routine
sucks, from tommorow I should buit a sleep routine and follow it.

Touched themes:
grid, minmax(), debugger in Firefox, min-content, max-content, auto-fit/fill, fraction unit, repeat(), auto-rows/columns 

Conclusion:

1. Almost finished course (1 hour of content left)
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
