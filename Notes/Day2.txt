Today I chose another course: 7 challenges in 7 days
There are 7 simple pages with beginner level a bit theory
I made 3 of them and then stopped because next steps is just waste of time.
Today I have reminded about background shortcut property and negative margin

I realized that I again decided wrong course,
there is a big change that there few FREE courses which can provide useful
information with practical examples. That certain course has only purpose to find a new
clients for author.

Conclusion:

1. Important! You made the same mistake again, decide a right course (give more 10 minutes)
for intermediate level otherwise it is just wasting of time.
2. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac
3. Think about switch to Visual Studio Code because Live Edit in WebStorm is working terrible
4. If you take lesson from some course, write down the themes which were touched during learning
