I have finished CSS Advanced course today, there were last lessons with GRID, to be honest I passed some lessons without strong focus and concius,
because I feel myself very tired, because I played footbal today and walk a lot. Yeasterday I will create total review note of this course.
Also I spent almost 3 hours on preparation for Angular Interview, discovered new things about lifecycle hooks, async pipe and Injector tree.
Also I had speaking club today and visit cinema at night, so it was obvious that I would not be able to finish course appropriately.

Touched themes:
grid, minmax(), debugger in Firefox, min-content, max-content, auto-fit/fill, fraction unit, repeat() 

Conclusion:

1. Finished CSS Advanced course
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
