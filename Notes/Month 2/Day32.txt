Today I have written tests for Homes Component and HomesService, loaded data from a JSON file and passed it further to template and rendered it.
Also I have compared how we write tests and which types of test we have written for my job project, and I found that we didn't write tests for Components,
only for Services, methods and pipes. Author of that course is using outdated syntax for some things, which can be implemented with power of DI in Angular

Conclusion
1. Continued challenge
2. Wrote and ran first Service tests
3. Compared how we write tests on my job project
