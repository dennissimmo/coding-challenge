Regular day almost without a practice. Today was introduction in Sass, I familiared with
mixins, functions, extends, nesting, variables and how it all looks in clear CSS.
We discussed how to build clean CSS architecture, rename styles in a BEM manner and 
configured Sass for our study project.

Today was a hard day at work I woke up at 7 oclock, started my work day at 7:40
and finished it at 16:20. I came home at 17:00 and was preparing for my English lesson,
after it was a Speaking club to 20:45, after it I took a rest, ate something,
and started challenge after 22:00

Touched themes:
SCSS, Architecture, Components, NPM

Conclusion:

1. Continued course (10 lessons more passed, SCSS)
2. Get a base of SCSS
3. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
4. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
5. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
