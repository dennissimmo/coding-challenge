In the second part of Flexbox, we implemented left right animation with help fo ::before pseudo element,
learned about "currentColor" and "fill" property of an SVG icon, created infinity pulsing animation,
used SVG icons in CSS together with "mask-image", mastered Flex Box, how margin: auto works on flex items
 and implemented all sections of project. Next step is writing media queries and we can move to GRID section

It probably was the easiest part for me as Flex Box it something which I knew the best except "flex" property itself, but now I
understand how it works and how to use it.

Touched themes:
mask-image, SVG in CSS, complex animation, fill and currentColor, transform-origin

Conclusion:

1. Continue Advanced SCSS course (7 lessons more passed)
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
