Today I have spent more 2 hours on learning Angular architecture, I have implemented reusable input element with emplementing Control Value Accessor for behaving custom input as 
Angular Form Control and also created a form field with <ng-content> and set of input paramethers. I have read an article about ControlValueAccessor and I think understood how it works
and why we need it. I can do more today, but I decided to finish watching of 4th Peaky Blinders season.

Conclusion
1. Learned how works ControlValueAccessor, why we need it and implemented custom input with it.
2. Understood that I can do things well, when I really want and I just should believe in myself and keep going
3. Do not be afraid of some things, because of thoughts, that you did not deserve something, or not ready yet for something
