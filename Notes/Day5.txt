Today I remind a lot and learn some new things, especially how to set margin and padding
to align multiple blocks. Also I have added header, simple nav and border seciton.
That day was mostly theoretical with a little practice.

Touched themes:
Today I reminded about position, background, semantic tags, margin collapsing, inline elements,
possibility of adding custom tags through dev console ("Elements") tab.

Conclusion:

1. Started new course (30 lessons passed)
2. Reminded about many CSS specifics
3. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find finally it)
4. Today is Christmas in my country, yeasterday I have to do more
