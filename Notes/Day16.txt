This 4 hours were for @media queries and adaptive images. To be honest I completed Day 16 at the next day,
because yesterday I had a meeting with friends in one of our local pubs. I learned some things how to more 
optimize media queries, handle supporting some properties by browsers, how to combine, separate query conditions.
There was a big block about responsive images, their configuration through HTML for <img/>, or through CSS, it 
allows to us load different images based on 'display density', 'display width', set images width based on some media queries.
Also we have configured some additional scripts for different tasks and created global one in order to build project.

Also I do not have time to complete Day 17 where I was due to it, because I have wake up tommorow early, so tommorow I have
complete tasks for 2 days and spend minimum 4 hours on it.

Touched themes:
responsive images, media queries, @supports, only screen, ::selection, scripts

Conclusion:

1. Continue Advanced SCSS course (8 lessons more passed)
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
