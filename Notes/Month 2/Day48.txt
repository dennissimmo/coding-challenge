Today I have created signIn, signUp, logOut effects, after that added email-verification with redirection to email-confirm component.
Created email-confirm, registration, login modules / component, setup routes for auth module.
Implemented Registration component , formGroup with controls, repeatPasswordValidator, updateOnBlur, submit with dispatching Action and selector getLoading
for displaying loadingSpinner during request.

Conclusion:
1. Learned how to pass custom validators to formGroup
2. Refreshed knowledge about Registration process with usage Firebase Authorization
3. Practiced writing NGRX elements (selectors, effects)
4. Configured lazy loading for an Auth module
