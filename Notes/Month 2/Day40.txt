Today I learned how on practice go through last steps of bloom's taxonomy. You have to documenting what you have learn, what exact elements of it do, experiment with 
different values in diffirent situations, analyze how it can behave if tommorow remove some specific block from the page, or content there will be more content.
Create CodePens or do it in your owns projects and repository, make notes, comments, so you come later and figure out how you did something and how it works.
Today was theory without practice

Conclusion: 
1. Got an example how on practice go through last levels of BLOOM'S Taxonomy
