Today I have started building NGRX store for its app, created actions, models, reducer for dictionaries and READ effect for Dictionaries with handling success and error loading.
Reminded advantages of using NGRX store over Subject/Services approach, compared old syntax of writing reducers, actions, effects with new one in NGRX 8+

Conclusion:

1. Started creation of NGRX store for app
2. Refreshed knowledge about NGRX and its usage
