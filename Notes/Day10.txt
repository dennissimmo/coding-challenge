Today wasn't many practice because I have learned how CSS is parsed by a browser and other advanced staff.
Now I know which parts passes index.html file before visual rendering in a browser. Browser starts by 
parsing HTML loading CSS in paralell, by parsed HTML we are getting DOM, the parsing of CSS is done in two stages
1. Cascade (importance, specificity, source order, resolving conflicts)
2. Process finall CSS values (converting relative units to pixels + Inheritance)
As a result we are getting CSS Object Model, this one with DOM is a Render Tree.
And from this Render Tree browser rendering the visuall formatting model (Border Box, Box Types, Positioning, Stacking Context)
Also I have converted all 'px' values to 'rem' values.

Because of late start of a working day and some home staff, I spent only 2 hours today and I should go sleep.


Touched themes:
Box Model, Inheritance, Relative Units, Inline elements, rem vs px, Cascade

Try to make commit before midnight, because in Git history it looks like you missed some days, when you actually aren't.

Conclusion:

1. Started new course (8 lessons more passed)
2. Improved knowledge about how CSS is parsed and website is rendered
3. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
4. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
5. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
