Today I have finished Bakery project. We touch a few times and I 
realized that I again decided wrong course, not almost wrong but no that
one which was needed. Current course is for Beginners, but I want to take
more advanced course. Today I started learning Figma and have created 
my first Figma Project.

Touched themes:
Gradient, fonts, border boxing, elements alignments. Figma, UI and UX.

Conclusion:

1. Continued course (40 lessons passed)
2. Finished Figma basic course
3. Today was very inconsistent day
4. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
5. When I'm writing this post it very late time and I'm feeling myself very tired
