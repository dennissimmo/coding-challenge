Today I learned how it is important to try to teach other people, try to explain something to them with usage of different approaches articles, videos, forums.
Consider Dev.to as a starting point to writing articles on some topics and answer to questions in different Angular communities, you have enough experience
to help others fix theirs problems in Angular in effective way and offer multiple approaches with different concepts of Angular and even solving problems
in different ways with imperative or declarative programming. Do not try to make things perfect, leave 10% on some mistakes, because if you will try 
make everything perfect you never start it at all. Write a list what you want to learn, track a progress, repeat it periodically, discuss, view on it from 
different perspective, experiment and it will help you.
