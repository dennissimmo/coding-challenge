Today we started again with a new coure, but finally it suited my needs (at least half of them).
P.S What you want from a free course)

Lectures are combined with practice, information is useful, all edge case are touched.

Touched themes:
Today I practiced flex-box, transition, transform, practiced with font-awesome icons.
I learned how to make scale on hover with margin (what I needed yesterday)
and created header, sidebar and featured sections, in short I have finished 1 section (CSS only)
Also I have switched to Visual Studio Code and with a few plugins it works better then WebStorm especially Live Editing

Left practice section (about an hour) we will end up with slider, dark mode and responsive design

Conclusion:

1. I like that course, but It would be better to buy more advenced and long course
2. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find finally it)
3. Switch to VS code was right decition, but also I have try to use GULP with live reloading plugin, may be it works better
