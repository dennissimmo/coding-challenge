The first part of this lesson I've started 26.01.2023 and finished 29.01.2023. There we have implemented
header and first section and made it responsive for all devices.
I learned how to edit some class when we are calling to some elements itself .menu_open & {} and worked with adaptive value.
Also we made adaptive scroll, during scrolling it has one height after scrolling another height.

Touched themes:
BEM, layout analyze, gap, adaptive value

Conclusion:

1. Made 2 sections of layout, consolidate knowledge on practice
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
