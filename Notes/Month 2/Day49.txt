Today's day was not very productive as it was separated between two parts of day and it's outdated as well.
Within 1 hour and 20 minutes I finished login, welcome, not-found components, added links in header and their proper displaying. Added init action, effect that will 
automatically query active user if user is still authorized and section with Firebase is active, it is just a helper, it can be done via authState object.

Conclusion:
1. Added static pages and updated routing
2. Better understood how to work with effects and actions
3. Understood that spliting a lesson is a bad idea
