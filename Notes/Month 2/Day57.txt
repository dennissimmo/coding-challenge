Today I spent 1.5 hours for course that helps me to prepare for an interview in English, I learned how to do Follow-up Call, how to arrange time and date for it,
how to preparing for an interview, do some research, how to dress for an interview and some mental readiness.
Also there was a video about body language and small talk if we do an interview offline. I learned how to do self introduction, how to tell about my strengths and weaknesses.
The main rule "DO NOT TRY TO MEMORIZE", have a plan but be genuine!

Conclusion: 
1. Continued Monthly challenge (I'm again out of day for 2 - 3 days)
2. Got some pieces of advice for interview's preparation and its start steps
3. Wrote down new vocabulary
