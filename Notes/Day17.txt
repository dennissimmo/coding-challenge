Today's two hours were mostly about Flex Box, we learned all main properties of it, which value
takes by default "flex" property, in which order set its values and considered its usage as best practice.
I learned that there might be some problems with icon font and proffesional solution for icons is using SVG icons.
We initialized new project and created header and half of a sidebar. I am actively using CSS variables
in that project because it has some advantages over SASS ones. By the next day I plan to finish
flex section at all and then only flex box section lefts.

Day 18 already will be finished after midnight in order to align in row days.

Touched themes:
CSS variables, Flex Box container, elements, conception, SVG


Conclusion:

1. Continue Advanced SCSS course (10 lessons more passed)
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
