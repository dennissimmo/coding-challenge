Today I have spent about 50 minutes directly on course, implemented test for opening Modal, created component for Modal and realized
that I had wrong expectations about that course, it has many outdated syntax and you must to investigate what caused your problem and how to fix it for specific
version of library. I want to stop doing that course, I burned out of it, maybe it is because I'm tired and cannnot manage instalation some apps on Kali Linux, which I needed
for completing laboratory work from Ecommerce. I have installed Parallels then Kali Linux, then for 40 minutes had been trying install that application, but sucked and decided 
to install Windows, we will see how it will going.

Conclusion
1. Continued challenge (only 45 minutes today)
2. Decided to stop Angular TDD course
3. Sucked with time management, even though woke up at 8 oclock
