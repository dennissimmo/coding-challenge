Today wasn't very productive day if we will talking about challenge. 
But today I spent 40 minutes to prepare for an interview, updated Resume, Directives block, Building blocks on an Angular,
questions for mobile screening interview. Also I have started new project with SASS usage in .scss syntax (that one which was created in Figma).
Also I want to add that I don't skip a day yesterday, I just made commit after midnight.

Touched themes:
SASS, CV, Mobile Screen Interview, Directives, Building blocks

Conclusion:

1. Updated resume
2. Watched Avatar 2: Way of water in the cinema
3. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
4. Discovered first Angular interview questions
5. Today I'm planning to finish that course (without Bootstrap section)
