Today I read articles about REM, pseudo classes and approaches for adding margin/padding. 
I spent about 6+ hours today, finished Figma project and adopted for Desktop and Tablet device, created a hamburger menu.
I realized I should artificially push (remind) myself to do things (layout) more quickly, because it takes to much time sometimes for very basic things.
My work with that course is finished, may be I wil adopt that project for mobile version as well but it will be not on that week.
The next step is to take more advanced course and complete its.

Touched themes:
SASS, Flex, min/max height/width, rem, em, types of layout (adaptive, responsive), BEM

Conclusion:

1. Finished course
2. Improved skills in BEM naming
3. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
4. Going to find new course with more advanced CSS concepts and tips
