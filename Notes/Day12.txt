Today we created a structure of our project, many folders and files, everything on their places.
I build today custom grid layout based on float property (1, 2, 3, 4 columns)
Learned about background-clip property, not selector, utility classes and property selector usage

I'm not stopping learning today, just want to make a commit before midnight

Touched themes:
SCSS, Architecture, Structure, grid, float

Conclusion:

1. Continued course (5 lessons more passed, grid, float)
2. Builded custom grid layout
3. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
4. Structured project
