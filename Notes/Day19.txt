Today I spent more 4 hours on finishing Flex project and some additional staff, I have tested
on mobile project from my main job 30% functionality of which I have implemented by myself,
also I have configured ngrok for VS code (installed extension) so now can test my study
projects on phone as well. After writing media queries for Flex project, I've implemented
menu on hover user name with select and messages popup as in Facebook on hover messages icon,
and did "suggestions" for input when user starts typing.

Last step left, GRID technology.
Probably I will take GRID section from another author, just for better understanding 
and to find new approach to studying and building layouts.

Touched themes:
Advanced selectors, responsive layout, flex properties 

Conclusion:

1. Finished Flex Box section
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
