Today I had a Spekiang Club and after it I couldn't manage my time in a proper way, and have finished
paying taxes only by 22:30 and started course over 23 oclock. Today I learned about how media query
max-width, min-width are working, mobile first and desktop first approaches and build up a mixin
manager, which allow us to easily update our website for different devices. Also I have created a popup
by using only SCSS and HTML.

I noticed that it looks something weird when course is a bit outdated and you still using float 
properties to build grid, whereas there are GRID and FLEX technologies.

Touched themes:
Adaptive Design, media queries, @mixin, @if, :target, Popup, hamburger icon animation

Conclusion:

1. Continue Advanced SCSS course (9 lessons more passed)
2. You have to set deadlines for your daily tasks
3. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
4. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
5. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
6. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
