Today was fist day when I took lessons from Angular Advanced course, I learned/reminded and most importantly
did on practice, some functionalities of Content projection, AfterContentInit, ContentChild-ren, ViewChild-ren,
selectors, practiced Renderer (old version). Learned how to create Dynamic components and inject it in some
template placeholder, how get its properties and methods, reordering and destroying it.
Learned how to create a custom template with <ng-template> and pass some context to it, also did the same
with ngTemplateOutlet directive.
Last but not least, better understood how differ Change Detection modes, especially when @Input value changes.


Touched themes:
Content Projection, Dynamic Components, TemplateRef, ContainerRef, ElementRef, Renderer, Change Detection, 
View Encapsulation

Conclusion:

1. Started Angular course (25 lessons more passed)
2. Reminded/learned details of ViewChild-ren, ContentChild-ren, Change Detection, ViewEncapsulation, etc.
3. Continued Advanced CSS course (3 lessons passed more)
4. Created footer, animation, navigation, positioning of hamburger menu
5. You have to pay attention on bottom listed conclusions, you don't follow them
6. Need to work on better time management (work schedule and sleep routine)
7. Have to improve speed of taking actions and decisions during building markup / layout
8. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac (find it finally)
