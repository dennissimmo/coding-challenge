Today I were playing with WebStorm setup:
- install Prettier
- learn new shortcuts
- burned of Live Edit function

Another things done:
- create repo
- chose course for learning
- implement header and feature sections from course lessons

I realized that I chose wrong course, it had many cons as:
- unstructured information
- not finished examples
- trash talk
- level of absolute beginners
- no SCSS
- bad practices

Conclusion:

1. Decide a new course with real examples and advices how to write correct CSS
2. Need to find an app to build multi layout window on Mac
3. Use SCSS
